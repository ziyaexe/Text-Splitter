Text Splitter
This is a simple, web-based tool for programmers to split their code into smaller, manageable parts. This is particularly useful for preparing code to be analyzed by large language models (LLMs) which often have token or character limits.

Features
Split by Characters: Break your code into chunks of a specified character count.

Split by Lines: Split your code by a certain number of lines per chunk.

Split by Custom Delimiter: Use a custom string (e.g., ---, }, class) to define where the code should be split.

Live Character Counter: See the total character count of your code in real time.

Copy Chunks: Easily copy individual chunks or all chunks to your clipboard.

Clear Functionality: Reset all inputs with a single click.

How to Use
Paste Your Code: Enter your code into the text area.

Select Split Method: Choose whether you want to split by characters, lines, or a custom delimiter.

Set Chunk Size: Specify the maximum size for each chunk.

Split: Click the "Split" button to generate the code chunks.

Copy: Use the copy buttons to get the code chunks you need.

This tool aims to simplify the process of breaking down large code files, making it easier to work with AI assistants, share snippets, or perform other tasks that benefit from smaller, self-contained code blocks.
